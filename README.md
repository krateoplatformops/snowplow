# `snowplow`

Snowplow is a web service that plays a key role within the suite of components that make up Krateo PlatformOps. 

It serves multiple purposes, primarily acting as a bridge between Krateo's custom resources and the UI. By enabling a dynamic and declarative approach to defining UI components and layouts, Snowplow ensures that the interface is interpreted and rendered seamlessly by Krateo Frontend.

It handles on-demand resolution of the `RESTAction` custom resource and all Krateo Frontend `Widgets` custom resources.
